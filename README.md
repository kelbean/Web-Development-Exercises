# Web-Development-Portfolio

For this assessment, we were tasked to apply what we have learned throughout our lectures to a set of web development exercises. Each chapter may consist of sub-folders that may contain the necessary content to properly run the website. Some may also contain optional exercises to achieve bonus marks. The assessment includes the following:
- Chapter 1 (Introduction to HTML & CSS)
- Chapter 2 (Links and Navigation)
- Chapter 3 (Images)
- Chapter 4 (Page Layout)
- Chapter 5 (Embedded Content)
- Chapter 6 (Javascript)
