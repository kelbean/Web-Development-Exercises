                An animated superhero series that revolves around 17-year-old Mark Grayson,
                who's just like every other guy his age — except his father is the most powerful
                superhero on the planet, Omni-Man. But as Mark develops powers of his own, he discovers
                his father’s legacy may not be as heroic as it seems.
